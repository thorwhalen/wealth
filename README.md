Visualizing financial relations and evolutions.

Stock picking is hard, and has a [terrible track record](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/stock-picking-has-a-terrible-track-record-and-its-getting-worse.html).

If you're going to do it, two things would go a long way in mitigating the

- building intuition based on multi-faceted facts
- being able to test ideas at the speed of thought

These are just tools to help out in that direction.
